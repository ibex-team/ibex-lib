VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
This package is generated from https://github.com/lebarsfa/ibex-lib/actions, which is a fork of the official IBEX GitHub source repository. The modifications made can be listed on https://github.com/ibex-team/ibex-lib/compare/master...lebarsfa:actions and it can be seen that there were only additions related to package generation. The automated build log can be seen by clicking on "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x64" and "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x86" jobs on https://github.com/lebarsfa/ibex-lib/actions, and signing in with GitHub. In particular, a sha256 checksum is visible for each generated .nupkg, as it is computed in https://github.com/lebarsfa/ibex-lib/blob/actions/.github/workflows/unixmatrix.yml using checksum command. Those temporary .nupkg are available on https://github.com/lebarsfa/ibex-lib/releases and are used to create this package : it can be checked e.g. using WinMerge that x86 folder from this package contains the bin, include, lib, share folders from the "--x86" package on https://github.com/lebarsfa/ibex-lib/releases and all the other folders are from the non-"--x86" package.
