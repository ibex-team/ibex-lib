 * NOTE: one limitation of this implementation is that the number of variables
 *       is fixed to (m+1)*n where m is the total number of constraints, whereas
 *       m should be dynamically set to the number of active constraints only.
 *       However, with the current interface of LPSolver, the only way to change
 *       the number of variables is to delete and recreate a LPSolver object,
 *       which drastically slows down the optimizer.
