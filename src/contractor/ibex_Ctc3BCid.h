  /**
   * \brief Creates the 3BCID contractor for the contractor \a ctc.
   *
   * \param ctc           (Sub)contractor to be applied on each slice/sub-interval. Remark: we have
   *                      observed that using \a ctc=Box is generally a bad idea (except in the
   *                      benchmark Yamamura1), contrary to \a HC4 or \a Mohc.
   * \param s3b           Maximum number of slices that can be eliminated by the shaving process.
   *                      \a s3b is simply the inverse of the more standard main parameter of 3B.
   *                      Example: for a value of s3b equal to 20, the "linear" shaving process
   *                      splits the studied interval [x] in at most 20 sub-intervals, each having
   *                      a width equal to 5% of \a x.diam(); the "dichotomic" shaving process
   *                      handles slices of width at least 5% of x.diam(). Principle of the
   *                      "linear" shaving (the "dichotomic" shaving is more complicated) applied
   *                      to the left side and then to the right side of [x]. For the left (resp.
   *                      right) side, from left to right (resp. from right to left), every sub-
   *                      interval [x_i] in the left (resp. right) bound of [x] is computed; \a the
   *                      subcontractor \a ctc is called on the corresponding sub-box [B_i] (i.e.,
   *                      the current box [B] in which [x] is replaced by [x_i], the other intervals
   *                      being left unchanged); if [B_i] is empty, then it ensures that [x_i] can
   *                      be safely removed from [x] (no solution in this slice) and the process
   *                      continues on the next rightmost (resp. leftmost) slice; if [B_i] is not
   *                      empty, with [x_i] eventually reduced to [x_i]', the left (resp. right)
   *                      shaving terminates and the corresponding sub-box [B_left] (resp. [B_right])
   *                      is stored to be handled by the CID process (see below). We have observed
   *                      that the \a s3b parameter has often the most significant impact on performances
   *                      and thereby should be tuned in priority by the user. The best value of \a s3b
   *                      generally ranges between 5 and 200, 10 being the default value.
   * \param scid          Maximum number of slices that can be contracted by the CID (constructive
   *                      disjunction) contractor. Principle: when the standard shaving process in a
   *                      given variable x is finished, the remaining interval is split into \a scid
   *                      slices (of equal width); the sub-contractor \a ctc is then applied to these
   *                      slices and the \a scid returned contracted boxes, plus [B_left], plus
   *                      [B_right], are hulled, i.e., the smallest box enclosing these \a scid+2
   *                      sub-boxes is returned. Thus, when handling a given variable x with var3BCID,
   *                      the constructive interval disjunction allows contracting the box in several
   *                      dimensions. Fixing \a scid to 0 amounts in calling a "standard" shaving
   *                      (contracting only [x]); the value 1 is the default value and a greater value
   *                      rarely produces better performances. Therefore the user should generally not
   *                      play with this parameter!
   * \param vhandled      Number of calls to \a var3BCID, i.e., the number of variables that are handled
   *                      in one call to the contract method (all variables by default). Remark:
   *                      \a vhandled is used to reach a "fixpoint" in terms of contraction. \a vhandled
   *                      is preferred to the precision parameter used in the standard 3B that manages
   *                      the number of loops over all the variables.
   * \param var_min_width The minimum width an interval must have to be shaved. The default value is 1e-11
   *                      but the actual default value should depend on the precision of the solutions
   *                      (#ibex::CtcPrecision::ceil): \a var_min_width should be by default one or
   *                      several orders of magnitude under #ibex::CtcPrecision::ceil. \a var_min_width
   *                      is used to adjust the actual number \a s3b of slices considered by the shaving
   *                      so as to ensure that a slice has a width greater than \a var_min_width, as follows:
   *                      actual_s3b = Min(s3b, floor(x.diam()/var_min_width)). Remark: the user should
   *                      generally <b>not</b> play with this parameter in priority because assigning
   *                      \a var_min_width to a value greater than #ibex::CtcPrecision::ceil is interesting
   *                      in only a few structured systems, e.g., in Yamamura1 that can found in the
   *                      COCONUT/COPRIN benchmarks.
  * \param cid_vars       The mask indicating the subset of variables to be shaved.
  *                       Example: this parameter has been used by Araya et al. in conjunction with the
  *                       preprocessing algorithm I-CSE (see Proc. of CP 2008): I-CSE produces a system
  *                       in which are added new auxiliary variables corresponding to common sub-
  *                       expressions in the initial system; during the search of solutions that follows,
  *                       the new auxiliary variables are not shaved and are thus removed from \a cid_space.
