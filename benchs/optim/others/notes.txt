Probably need to desactivate symbolic differentation:
	dualc1
	polygon25


Very instable:
  ex14_1_6. May be solved in less than 1s or ...
  
  
  
ex8_4_5-1.bch: 
raise an ibex::Exception with release 2.5

test_infinity3:
problem has unbounded objective and unbounded variable domain (which is not supposed to be really supported)
release 2.5 terminates instantaneously or never depending on random seed (test with 1.0 and 2.0)
