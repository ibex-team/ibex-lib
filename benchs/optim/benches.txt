This directory contains the benchmark for global optimization


The mainpart comes from coconut benchmark Library1 
http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~neum/glopt/coconut/Benchmark/Library1_new_v1.html

All the characteristics of these problems can be found on this webpage


All the optimization problems from Library1 with less than 50 variables  and without integer variables are in this directory, coded in Quimper.
A few other problems are also coded (unconstrained problems with additional always satisfied constraints).


The unbounded variables are declared with domains [-1.e8,1.e8]

The equality constraints are relaxed by two inequalities  with eps=1.e-8


The files suffixed by  -1  are variants with different domains for some variables
                   by bis are variants with another formulation of the same problem
