	 *
	 * Given a constraint "c", we say that a point is "inside" (resp. "outside") if it satisfies

	 * inside/outside c.
	 *
	 * This method takes an initial point "p" and an enclosing box "x". It tries to inflate p 
	 * inside x with respect to a constraint "c" or its negation. That is, it builds a box "y", 
	 * containing p and contained in "x": 
	 * <br/> 
	 *                       p &isin; y &sube; x 
	 * <br/>   
	 * If in==TRUE, y must be inside c. Otherwise, it must be outside.

	 *                 (x1-,x1+,x2-,x2+,...,xn-,xn+), where xi- (resp. xi+) is the
	 *                 lower (resp. upper) bound of the domain of x_i.
	 *
	 * @param in     - TRUE if the box has to be inflated inside c (-> inner region), 
	 *                 FALSE if it has to be inflated outside c (-> forbidden region).	 
	 *

	 *                     could not be inflated to a "significant" box y. A box y is considered to
	 *                     be significant if, on <b>each</b> of its dimension, the width of the 
	 *                     interval y_i is at least RATIO times the width of x_i.

	 *                     (reps. outside) the constraint.
	 *
